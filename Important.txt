YAML - YAML ain't markup language - Data Serialization language

Serialization is a process of converting data object (combination of data + code) into a series of bytes that saves the state of object in a form that is easily transmittable.

Reverse of this is also known as deserialization.

A YAML file is a text document that contains data formatted using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data format used for data serialization. It is used for reading and writing data independent of a specific programming language.
